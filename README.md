- **Storage**: ~3GB free space for AI model

## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Install Chrome Extension

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-review-ai.git
   ```

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top right corner)

4. Click **"Load unpacked"**

5. Select the `code-review` directory

6. The extension icon should appear in your toolbar

### Step 2: Enable Chrome AI Features

**This is critical! The extension won't work without this step.**

1. Open a new tab and navigate to:
   ```
   chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano-multimodal-input
   ```

2. Find **"Prompt API for Gemini Nano"**

3. Change the dropdown from **"Default"** to **"Enabled"**

4. Click the **"Relaunch"** button that appears at the bottom

5. Chrome will restart with AI features enabled

### Step 3: Download AI Model (First-Time Only)

The first time you use the extension, Chrome needs to download the Gemini Nano model (~3GB). This is a **one-time** process.

**What to expect:**

1. Navigate to any GitHub or GitLab PR
2. Click the **"AI Review"** button
3. The extension will show: *"AI model is downloading (5-10 minutes)"*
4. The download happens in the background‚Äîyou can close the tab
5. The extension auto-checks status every 30 seconds
6. Once complete, click **"AI Review"** again to analyze the PR

**To manually check download status:**

Open Chrome DevTools Console (F12) and run:
```javascript
await LanguageModel.availability()
// Returns: "downloadable", "downloading", or "available"
```

## üìñ Usage

### Running a Code Review

1. **Navigate to a Pull Request**
   - Open any GitHub PR (e.g., `https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pulls`)
   - Or any GitLab merge request

2. **Start Review**
   - Look for the **"AI Review"** button in the PR header
   - Click it to start analysis
   - The side panel will open automatically

3. **View Results**
   - Review appears in structured sections
   - Color-coded tags highlight bugs, security issues, performance concerns
   - Code blocks are syntax highlighted
   - Markdown formatting makes it easy to read

### Using Interactive Q&A

After the review completes, you can ask follow-up questions:

1. **Open Q&A Section**
   - Scroll down in the side panel
   - Click **"üí¨ Ask Questions About This Review"**

2. **Ask Questions**
   - Type your question (up to 500 characters)
   - Examples:
     - *"How do I fix the security vulnerability in section 4?"*
     - *"Can you explain the N+1 query issue with code examples?"*
     - *"What's the best way to refactor this for better performance?"*
   - Press **Ctrl+Enter** or click **"Ask"**

3. **Get Contextual Answers**
   - AI remembers the PR context and previous review
   - Answers reference specific sections
   - Includes code examples when applicable
   - Conversation history is preserved

4. **Continue the Conversation**
   - Ask follow-up questions
   - Last 3 Q&As are maintained for context
   - Each new PR review starts a fresh Q&A session

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "AI is not defined" Error

**Cause**: Chrome AI features not enabled or Chrome version too old

**Solution**:
1. Check Chrome version: `chrome://version/` (need Chrome 140+)
2. Enable the flag: `chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano-multimodal-input`
3. Relaunch Chrome completely
4. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`

### "AI model is downloading..." Stuck

**Cause**: Download is still in progress or failed

**Solution**:
1. Wait 10-15 minutes (download can be slow on slower connections)
2. Check download status in DevTools console:
   ```javascript
   await LanguageModel.availability()
   ```
3. If stuck, restart Chrome and try again
4. Ensure you have 3GB+ free disk space

### "No response from AI" Error

**Cause**: Extension context was invalidated or service worker terminated

**Solution**:
1. Reload the extension: Go to `chrome://extensions/` ‚Üí Click reload icon
2. Refresh the PR page
3. Try clicking "AI Review" again

### Review Button Not Appearing

**Cause**: Page not fully loaded or content script failed to inject

**Solution**:
1. Refresh the PR page
2. Check if you're on the PR "Conversation" or "Files changed" tab
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Ensure extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`

### Q&A Not Working

**Cause**: PR data not stored or AI API unavailable

**Solution**:
1. Run a fresh code review first
2. Ensure the review completed successfully
3. Check that the Q&A section appeared after review
4. Verify AI model is available (not downloading)

## üèóÔ∏è Development

### Project Structure

```
code-review/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json       # Extension configuration (Manifest V3)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js       # Service worker for AI API calls
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js          # Content script for PR page injection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sidebar.html        # Side panel UI with Q&A interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sidebar.js          # Side panel logic and Q&A handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # Injected styles for PR button
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icons/              # Extension icons (16, 48, 128px)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ABOUT.md            # Project story and journey
```

### Key Components

**background.js**
- Handles AI API calls (LanguageModel, Summarizer)
- Dual API pattern support (global & namespaced)
- Service worker keep-alive mechanism
- Q&A context management

**content.js**
- Injects "AI Review" button into PR pages
- Extracts PR data (title, description, diff)
- Handles GitHub and GitLab DOM differences
- Opens side panel for results

**sidebar.js**
- Displays review results with markdown formatting
- Manages Q&A conversation state
- Handles user interactions (questions, toggle)
- Auto-saves Q&A history to chrome.storage

### Testing Locally

1. Load the extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
2. Open any public GitHub PR:
   - Example: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pulls
   - Or search for PRs with substantial code changes
3. Click "AI Review" button
4. Open DevTools Console (F12) to see API interactions
5. Test Q&A by asking follow-up questions

### API Compatibility

The extension supports both Chrome AI API patterns:

```javascript
// Global pattern (newer)
await LanguageModel.create()
await Summarizer.create()

// Namespaced pattern (older)
await ai.languageModel.create()
await ai.summarizer.create()
```

Automatic detection ensures compatibility across Chrome versions.

**Why CodeReview AI Stands Out:**
- ‚úÖ Solves real developer pain points (slow, inconsistent code reviews)
- ‚úÖ Privacy-first architecture (all local, no cloud)
- ‚úÖ Professional-grade review quality (9 structured sections)
- ‚úÖ Interactive Q&A for learning and problem-solving
- ‚úÖ Beautiful, polished UI with attention to detail
- ‚úÖ Works across Chrome versions (dual API support)

**Impact:**
- Democratizes senior-level code review expertise
- Reduces PR review time from hours to seconds
- Educational tool for junior developers
- Catches bugs and security issues before merge
